                    <p>Growing up i always had an interest in drawing. whenever i think back to primary or high school, i am always drawing on something, my books, the table, myself. I never took drawing too seriously until about 2 years ago when i made a few artist friends and realised that this is the area i want to put myself into. I studying a lot on youtube, before going to university in 2019 for a Diploma of 3D Animation. Completed with credit on most units. The reason i took on the diploma was due to the aspect of Production Art that came with it. Creating concept art is where my passion is. I am also putting my abilities towards working on a graphic novel of my own design.</p>
