I was always the most tech-savvy in my family, even though I am the youngest. During my primary school years I would play online kids games that built my problem solving skills. I was facinated by the online world and I remember asking my family how I could make my own website. Unfortunately my family did not know much about computers so they did not know how to help me.</p>\n                    <p>Skipping ahead to high school, my interest for technology continued. During my free time I would experiment with altering CSS and personalising my old social media pages. When I was 14 I was involved in a state wide competition called ‘RoboCup Junior’. Groups of students from various schools around the state had the opportunity to build and program our own robot that would dance to music. The end goal of the project was to enter the competition in dance-off’s against the other state schools, which had a chance to go Australia wide.</p>\n                    <p>It was around this time that I also discovered my interest for drama and performing. I had the opportunity to join a group of like minded students at Shopfront Theatre where I was able to be involved in multiple live performance productions, which I had acted in, and contributed to the writing and production of. Such performances were; The Tuesday Clan (2006) in which I had my own segment called ‘Caroline’s Commute’, The Nimbs (2007), and Villainous Business (2008). One of the performances I was a part of was a street performance called Lost Toy Story (2008) performed on the streets of Hurstville. During my final year at Shopfront I was involved in another couple of projects which were amateur short films; I.R.L (2009), Remove Before Show (2009), and Studio09 (2009).</p>\n                    <p>After completing the HSC (Higher School Certificate) I decided I wanted to further my education. This lead me to completing a Certificate IV in Information Technology (Web Design) at TAFE, achieving distinctions and credits for most units. I found my time at TAFE to be one of the most enjoyable years of my life as it allowed me to dive straight into developing practical skills that were relevant to the career I want to pursue. In order to gain further qualifications in the field I moved to Brisbane, Queensland, to attend university at Queensland University of Technology. University gave me the opportunity to explore different options and aspects of information technology.</p>\n                    <p>During my time in Brisbane I also worked part-time as an administration assistant at Guardian Childcare Alliance. It was this job that really emphasised my interest in working with technology as it opened up chances for me to work with databases and data management. This was also my first opportunity to work in an office environment where I could learn to become more professional and gain a deeper understanding of how a company operates on a business level.</p>\n                    <p>I moved back to Sydney to complete my Bachelor's degree in Information and Communications Technology at Western Sydney University. I participated in a university program called Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) which gave me the skills and mentorship I needed to prepare myself for beginning my career. During this time I also discovered my passion for coding extends to video game development. I competed in a video game development competition held by Western Sydney University, and supported by Wargaming.Net. The competition required me to build a video game in Unity and complete a 5 minute presentation of my game. I had placed 3rd in this competition and received an award. My game 'The Other Side' can be found in the 'Projects' section of this website.</p>\n                    <p>During and after uni I worked at an arcade called Playtime (now known as TimeZone). I performed customer service duties, as well as host children's birthday parties and perform some technical maintainance on arcade machines. Working with arcade games helped me learn the importance of different gaming aspects that keep the player engaged. Such as, if the game volume was too loud or quiet, or the movement and vibration functions of the machine were not functioning, it would easily cause the player to lose interest in the game. It was also interesting to see how children and adults would react differently to certain games.</p>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"right-column\">\n                    <img className=\"photo\" src={CarolineChildImage} width=\"250px\" height=\"300px\" />\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default History;","import React from 'react';\nimport ImageGallery from 'react-image-gallery';\nimport \"react-image-gallery/styles/css/image-gallery.css\";\n\nconst nutritionCareImages = [\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/nutrition1.png',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/nutrition1.png',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/nutrition2.png',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/nutrition1.png',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/nutrition3.png',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/nutrition3.png',\n    },\n];\n\nconst SCTRImages = [\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/sctr1.png',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/sctr1.png',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/sctr2.png',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/sctr2.png',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/sctr3.png',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/sctr3.png',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/sctr4.png',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/sctr4.png',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/sctr5.png',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/sctr5.png',\n    },\n];\nconst refreshCleaningImages = [\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/refresh1.png',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/refresh1.png',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/refresh2.png',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/refresh2.png',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/refresh3.png',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/refresh3.png',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/refresh4.png',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/webDev/refresh4.png',\n    },\n];\n\nclass Projects extends React.Component {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div>\n                <h2>Web Development</h2>\n                {/* <ImageGallery items={nutritionCareImages} /> */}\n                <div className=\"wallOfText\">\n                    <h3>South Coast Tyre Recycling</h3>\n                    <p>During my last year at uni I completed a unit which gave me the opportunity to team up with others to work with a real client and gain work experience.</p>\n                    <p>My team and I met up with our assigned client and we discussed their project requirements.

I received full marks for my game, and it placed 3rd in the competition and I received an award by a representative from Wargaming.Net.</p>\n                    <p>The game I created is a first-person story telling game called ‘The Other Side’. The idea behind this game is to step away from explosions, guns, blood, and gore, and instead explore a different aspect of gaming. This game is about immersing yourself into a story. There are very few existing games that are similar to this one. I am creating this game to prove that a story does not need to be read or watched and there is more to be experienced within a game.</p>\n                    <p>The Other Side takes place at a modern day family home. The player controls a dog named Sam and explores the house as a little girl, Suzie, follows you. The aim of the game is to explore your surroundings and piece together clues in order to solve the mystery of a family member’s death. The player is able to discover clues by following scent trails and listening to the stories told by a ghost in the room. As the player begins to find clues, Suzie explains the significance of some objects, or the ghost will begin to recall memories or diary entries relating to that object.</p>\n                    <h4>A bit of background info on the characters in the game:</h4>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Sam is a 1 year old Golden Retriever. She was adopted by Jack after he found her a year ago, abandoned on the side of a road. Ever since, Sam has always accompanied Jack on his hunting trips and they have a strong bond between them.</li>\n                        <li>Suzie is an 8 year old girl who has always wanted a little brother or sister as she always feels quite lonely being an only child. When Jack brought Sam home, Suzie felt excited that she would now have a new friend to play with.</li>\n                        <li>Jack is a 68 year old man still mourning the loss of his wife, Helen. On a recent hunting trip with his son-in-law, he gets shot and killed. His spirit still lingers within the house, desperately trying to get a message across in any way he can.</li>\n                        <li>Helen passed away a year ago from an illness. She was the same age as Jack and they were happily married for many years.</li>\n                        <li>Linda is the daughter of Jack and Helen. She is 40 years old and is currently pregnant with her second child. She teaches at the local primary school.</li>\n                        <li>James is Linda’s husband and is 42 years old. He has been arrested for the murder of Jack.</li>\n                    </ul>\n                    <h4>The story being introduced at the start of the game:</h4>\n                    <p>Jack, James and Sam go on a hunting trip on Friday afternoon. They were planning to return on Sunday night, however Jack is shot, and killed, and James is arrested for his murder. Sam is the only one to return from the trip. When Sam returns, she notices a presence within the house, and soon recognises the presence as Jack’s ghost. Jack attempts to communicate with Sam, but can only do so in the form of memories. Sam realises that something is bothering Jack and he is trying to pass on a message to his daughter, Linda. It is Sam’s job to discover this message and find a way to pass this message on to Linda.</p>\n                    <p>The player completes the game when they uncover all the main clues in the game and solve the mystery of Jack’s death.</p>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"right-column\">\n                    <img className=\"photo\" src={Competition1} width=\"500px\" height=\"300px\" />\n                    <img className=\"photo\" src={Competition2} width=\"500px\" height=\"300px\" />\n                    <img className=\"photo\" src={Competition3} width=\"500px\" height=\"300px\" />\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"image-gallery\">\n                    <ImageGallery items={TOSImages} />\n                </div>\n            </div >\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default GameDev;","import React from 'react';\nimport ImageGallery from 'react-image-gallery';\nimport \"react-image-gallery/styles/css/image-gallery.css\";\n\nconst TDModelingImages = [\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod1.jpg',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod1.jpg',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod2.jpg',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod2.jpg',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod3.jpg',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod3.jpg',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod4.jpg',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod4.jpg',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod5.jpg',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod5.jpg',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod6.jpg',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod6.jpg',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod7.jpg',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod7.jpg',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod8.jpg',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod8.jpg',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod9.jpg',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod9.jpg',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod10.jpg',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod10.jpg',\n    },\n    {\n        original: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod11.jpg',\n        thumbnail: '../../resources/caroline/3DModeling/3dmod11.jpg',\n    },\n];\n\nclass TDModeling extends React.Component {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div>\n                <div className=\"left-column\">\n                    <h2>3D Modeling</h2>\n                    <p>I've never been a very creative or artistic person, however I decided to buy a graphics tablet and create some 3D models just for fun!</p>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"image-gallery\">\n                    <ImageGallery items={TDModelingImages} />\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default TDModeling;","import React from 'react';\nimport WebDev from './webDev.js';\nimport GameDev from './gameDev.js';\nimport TDModeling from './tdModeling.js';\n\nclass Projects extends React.Component {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n\n        this.state = {\n            webDevEnabled: false,\n            gameDevEnabled: false,\n            tDModelingEnabled: false\n        };\n    }\n\n    enableSection(webDevEnabled, gameDevEnabled, tDModelingEnabled) {\n        this.setState({ webDevEnabled: webDevEnabled });\n        this.setState({ gameDevEnabled: gameDevEnabled });\n        this.setState({ tDModelingEnabled: tDModelingEnabled });\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        const {\n            webDevEnabled,\n            gameDevEnabled,\n            tDModelingEnabled\n        } = this.state;\n        return (\n            <div>\n                <h1>Projects</h1>\n                <div>\n                    <button onClick={() => this.enableSection(true, false, false)}>Web Development</button>\n                    <button onClick={() => this.enableSection(false, true, false)}>Game Development</button>\n                    <button onClick={() => this.enableSection(false, false, true)}>3D Modeling</button>\n                </div>\n                {webDevEnabled ?

On weekends and evenings I like to binge watch TV shows or grab a great video game and play it for the fifth time. *cough* Skyrim *cough*</p>\n                            <p>If you'd like to know a bit more about me, select a category below.</p>\n                        </div>\n\n                        <div className=\"right-column\">\n                            <img className=\"photo\" src={CarolineCoffeeImage} width=\"270px\" height=\"300px\" />\n                        </div>\n\n                        <div>\n                            <button onClick={() => this.enableSection(true, false, false, false)}>History</button>\n                            <button onClick={() => this.enableSection(false, true, false, false)}>Projects</button>\n                            <button onClick={() => this.enableSection(false, false, true, false)}>Now</button>\n                            <button onClick={() => this.enableSection(false, false, false, true)}>Resume / Contact</button>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    {historyEnabled ? <History /> : null}\n                    {projectsEnabled ? <Projects /> : null}\n                    {nowEnabled ? <Now /> : null}\n                    {resumeEnabled ? <Resume /> : null}\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default Caroline;","import React from 'react';\nimport BackToHome from '../../common/backToHome.js';\n\nclass Aaron extends React.Component {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div>\n                <BackToHome />\n                <div className=\"container\">\n                    <div className=\"left-column\">\n                        <h1>Aaron</h1>\n                        <p>Hello there!
